The chemistry of the Swishies is unrivaled. Which sometimes becomes even more evident off the court. Much to the fans' delight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>On early Monday, Maraño was in sentimental mode as she reposted a clip from Dy's vlog two years ago. They, along with Baron, participated in a True or False Challenge. "True or False, marupok si Tyang [Aby] among the three of you?" asked the host. The former two-time UAAP MVP admitted: "True. Very true."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Dy, however, quickly came to defend Tyang Aby, saying "Hindi marupok. Just forgiving."&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>After reposting the clip, the 30-year-old Maraño couldn't help but be a little introspective about what KKD said two years ago. The caption on her Instagram Story said: "Nakuha ko 'yung gigil mo dito @kiannady kasi hindi ako nakinig. Dapat talaga diyan pa lang 'enough is enough' na talaga, Swish. Mali! Mali! Lesson: Sometimes, your friends knows best, so listen."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://1cms-img.imgix.net/aby%20vlog.png" alt="" style=""></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>It's not totally clear what Maraño was referring to. But to recall, she and former PBA player Robert Bolick ended their relationship last year quite controversially.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But that's in the past now. Today, the F2 Logistics veteran is <a href="https://www.onesports.ph/more-sports/article/12575/her-side-of-the-court-our-lgbt-athletes-deserve-equal-respect-not-just-in-pride-month-but-all-year-round">very much happy with UP volleyball ace Kamille Cal</a>. And more importantly, she admitted her mistake and learned her lesson. Maraño has never shied away from expressing her feelings, and that's what makes her well-loved by fans.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Also, sorry KKD, if you ask us, we're always ready to be <a href="https://www.onesports.ph/gilas/article/12769/gilas-pilipinas-dwight-ramos-lays-out-plans-to-pay-it-forward">marupok for Dwight Ramos</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>`
